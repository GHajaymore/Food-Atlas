What has been asked for and not yet done. Newest requests at the top of each section;
anything finished moves out rather than getting a tick, because a list of completed work
is what git log is for.

## Waiting on Ajay — nothing else can happen until these do

**Deploy to Cloudflare Pages.** Everything built since 2026-08-23 runs only on a laptop
until this happens. `docs/deploy.md` has the three build settings. Then:

```
  npx wrangler d1 create wikifoodia          # paste the id into wrangler.toml
  npx wrangler d1 migrations apply wikifoodia --remote
  npx wrangler pages secret put IDENTITY_SECRET
  npx wrangler pages secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
```

**Cloudflare Web Analytics**, if visitor counts are wanted. Free, cookieless, and the
only honest way to answer "how many people" — see the foot of `functions/api/events.ts`.

## Decisions only Ajay can make

**The heritage branch gives Authentic at score 35.** A heritage designation plus
ingredients classifies Authentic — Regional through a branch that never reads the score,
so the same badge appears on a record scoring 35 and one scoring 58. Defensible — a PDO
*is* institutional recognition — and confusing. Verified by tracing the real ladder.

**`PROPOSAL_CONFIRMATIONS = 3`.** A dish known to four people in one village, none of
whom use the app, will never get in. Three is a starting position, not a finding.

## Next up

**User logins.** Ajay: *"if allowing user logins is helpful and may add more value, then
I have no issue"* (2026-08-23). This is the answer to *how do we know the same person is
not confirming twice under different names* — today the defence is a signed cookie, which
stops a double-tap and does not stop three private windows.

Recommended shape rather than a straight login wall:

- Google sign-in (free, no billing) as the identity, replacing `personId` in
  `functions/api/proposals/_middleware.ts`. That file is the only seam that changes.
- **Signed-in confirmations count toward the badge; anonymous ones display but do not.**
  This keeps the door open for the grandmother in Kozhikode who will not create an
  account, while making the number the badge rests on defensible. `validationsOf()`
  filters; `assess()` is untouched.
- The front page says "no accounts" in four places. **That wording has to change**, and
  it is the reason this is a decision rather than a task.

**Desktop, continued.** Ajay: *"still works like a mobile version with big pictures and
vertical scrolls — more of a website type"*. Done so far: responsive shell, wrapping
grids, a masthead, a two-column hero, larger cards, no duplicated wordmark. Still to do:

- A record page that is two columns on desktop, not one long scroll.
- Search with filters in a sidebar rather than stacked above the results.
- A real site footer.
- Hover states — there are none, and on a mouse that reads as a dead page.

## Smaller, and worth doing

**Indian-language Wikipedias are unread, and there is a lot there.** No Indian-language
wiki is cited anywhere in the atlas: every source is English Wikipedia or a
European-language Wikibooks. Sampling 50 Indian dishes against Wikidata, **80% have at
least one Indian-language Wikipedia article** — 177 articles across those 50, in Tamil,
Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Gujarati, Urdu, Marathi, Malayalam and
Telugu. None has been read.

`scripts/enrich-native-language.mjs` already handles this and already lists all eleven
Indian languages, correctly preferring a language of the place over a merely large one.
It has simply never been run against these records: **0 India records have
`sourceLanguage` set**, and 120 of 157 in `catalogue.json` have no preparation at all.
Running it is free and is the largest single source of new content available.

**Analytics: only dish opens are counted.** `count()` is wired into the record screen
and nowhere else. Searches, shelves and screens are all in the endpoint's allow-list and
nothing sends them.

**i18n coverage.** Twelve chrome translations exist and the picker now reaches them, but
Ajay's rule stands: finish extracting strings into the English catalogue across every
screen before translating anything else, or each new key means twelve retranslations.
`translationCoverage()` reports where each language stands.

**Stage 0.** A memory fix, not a bandwidth one — 122 MB heap, and the shipped payload is
mostly solved by compression at the host. `docs/architecture.md` says to measure again on
the real host before spending the refactor.
